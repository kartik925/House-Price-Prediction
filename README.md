# House-Price-Prediction
House  price  forecasting  is an  important  topic of  real  estate.  The  literature attempts  to 
derive  useful  knowledge  from  historical  data  of  property  markets.  Machine  learning 
techniques  are  applied  to  analyze  historical  property  transactions  in  India  to  discover 
useful  models  for  house  buyers  and  sellers.  Revealed  is  the  high  discrepancy  between 
house prices in the most expensive  and most affordable  suburbs in the  city of Mumbai. 
Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the Multiple Linear Regression that is based on 
mean squared error measurement is a competitive approach.
